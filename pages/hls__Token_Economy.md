- Tokens are to the Web3 what websites were to the Web1. With thee mergence  of  the  WWW in  1991,  Tim  Berner Lee  introduced a  new standard that allowed us to create visually appealing web pages with just a few lines of code, and surf the Internet following links, instead of using command-line interfaces. Back  in  the  early  1990s, most  people did  not know how to code HTML, or how to create appealing, meaningful, user-friendly websites.  It  took  us  almost a  decade to  figure  out  how  to  use webpages beyond the scope of online directories and online billboards, and when we did, the Web2 emerged. Compared to those early days of the Web, we are at a very similar stage when it comes to understanding what we can potentially do  with  cryptographic  tokens. While it  has  become  easy  to create a token with a few lines of code, the understanding of how to apply these tokens is still vague.

- While the Web2 was a front-end revolution, the Web3 is a backend revolution, introducing a universal state layer. It is a set of protocols led by a blockchain network or similar distributed ledger, which intends to reinvent how the Internet is wired in the backend. The Web3 combines the system functions of the Internet with the system functions of computers.

- Decentralized applications don’t necessarily need to run on top of a blockchain network.

	- The  protocol defines how  the participants in the network interact with each other: (i) under which conditions sending tokens from A to B is valid; (ii) the economic rewards for validating transactions with a cryptographic token; (iii) how to reference identities and sign transactions; and (iv) who decides over network upgrades.

- The blockreward gets reduced by 50 percent every 210,000 blocks, around every fouryears. The next “halving” of block rewards is in 2024.

- Furthermore, alternative distributed  ledger systems have  emerged with completely different types of consensus mechanisms, such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that do not require the creation of a chain of blocks anymore, and instead use alternative cryptoeconomic mechanisms to reach consensus. Examples of networks that use DAGs as a consensus mechanism are “IOTA,” “Byteball,” or “Nano.”
