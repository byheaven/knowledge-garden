- FEYNMAN'S DOZEN
	- >"You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your 12 problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: "How did he do it? He must be a genius!" — Richard Feynman
	- Make a list of a dozen problems. Pin it somewhere.
